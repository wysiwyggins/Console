The story goes that a [...] miner, unwilling to believe that the pit he worked had been exhausted, moved with his family into the mine after it was closed. There he doggedly searched for a new seam. Eventually he found one, and other miners join him to build a subterranean, utopian Coal Town-an autonomous underworld environment, artificially lighted and ventilated and capable of supporting human life in complete independence from the surface world.
