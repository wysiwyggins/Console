# README

This is a repository where I am trying to bring a few different disparate javascript projects together, with the idea that they are different programs on an imaginary (haunted) alternate history computing device. 
All the sketches here use the 'libuše' tileset in different ways. 

There are two html files in public/ - patterns.html and dungeon.html. Dungeon is my roguelike game experiment, patterns is a page for the other scripts: abyss, keyboard, knit, and saltwave. To view them, replace the script loaded at the bottom of patterns.html and use a local server to load the page (for instance in VS Code).

The way text reads affects how we imagine the flow of time maps to space (Bergen and Chan Lau 2012), (Yang and Sun 2018), (Park, Gagné, and Spalding 2024). A writer of Mandarin may speak of moving ‘downward’ into tomorrow just as they write text starting at the top of a page and working downward (the mandarin word xià means both “next” and “down”(Park, Gagné, and Spalding 2024, 02). On a surface level we may say that time itself has no spatial aspect, and these metaphors that ascribe a directional axis to time begin with language and writing, but there are powerful precedents to consider. To fall downward is to be caught up in the flow of time helplessly. To walk forward is to move by one’s own volition or march with a group in time. Benjamin describes the Angel of time as being blasted backwards into the future with wings like sails that cannot be closed. It’s a road too far to say that these feelings of moving bodily through time are what informs writing systems, but there is a tight relationship between the phenomenology of moving bodily through time and the construction of thought through writing. 

Early computer games used writing characters on a grid to form active, maplike images to be explored by players. They confused the image and the written word, as well as orientation. Characters in an interface might be read left to right, they might be parsed as one looks down on a map, but animated through time. 

My angel of history is the mythological Czech prophetess Libuše, a pagan witch who in stories foretells the founding of the city of Prague. In my allegory Libuše moves downwards into the past, as the Ore mountains in her prophecy were mined first for silver and then for uranium(Veselovský, Ondruš, and Komínek 1997). The rulers of the land changed her prophecy each time power changed hands. The prophetess knows the future because she is forced to speak the words of future writers. Her words are not heard in the past, which is filled with the dead, who are unmoved, but by us in the future.

Libuše may have been born from a mistranslation. Kosmas of Prague first names her in Chronica Boemorum in 1125, but his listing of the names of the Přemyslov family (Libuše’s family, mythical chieftains of the early Czech tribe) too closely match what could be a latin transcription of old Slavic words warning off Frankish aggressors. The prophetess herself is an artifact of language.

In 1817 a forgery of a medieval manuscript tried to position Libuše as a named figure further into the past than Kosmas. The future she foretells is continuously changing. This is not a rare exception- myths jealously push their way into the past by way of forgery and careful insertions into archives. 

The grid here is time and space. The glyphs are both pieces of larger images and maps, letterforms that can be written in four directions or animated, and symbols that carry their own meaning. Text is mined from several sources, including De Re Metallica, the medieval mining text that transitioned alchemy into the science of metallurgy. The text was written during the first era of mining the Ore mountains in what was once Bohemia. This was where minted coinage was standardized in Europe (the “thaler”, etymological root of the modern word “dollar”) and later where radioactive pitchblende was first used in fluorescent glazes for glasswork, and then by the Curies to distill radium. De Re Metallica was first translated to English from the Latin by Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover. The latter, a mining engineer before his political career and the former, his wife, a geologist who wrote both Latin and Mandarin.
