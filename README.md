# README

This is a repository where I am trying to bring a few different disparate javascript projects together, with the idea that they are different programs on an imaginary (haunted) alternate history computing device. 
All the sketches here use the 'libu≈°e' tileset in different ways. 

There are two html files in public/ - patterns.html and dungeon.html. Dungeon is my roguelike game experiment, patterns is a page for the other scripts: abyss, keyboard, knit, and saltwave. To view them, replace the script loaded at the bottom of patterns.html and use a local server to load the page (for instance in VS Code).
