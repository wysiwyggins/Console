# Console App

This repository aims to unify several disparate JavaScript projects, envisioning them as different programs on an imaginary (haunted) alternate history computing device. Each sketch utilizes the 'Libuše' tileset in unique ways.

## Introduction

### About

The Didaktik Gama App is a collection of public HTML documents, each with a separate JavaScript rendering in a canvas, either using Pixi.js or p5.js. The project is packaged with Electron to behave as a native application for macOS and Windows. A server script keeps track of global variables shared between the pages.

Each public page features a different experiment using a spritesheet of glyphs and a collection of sounds sampled from a single physical instrument or an oscillator.

Skip backwards and forwards in the pages with { and }
close the application with esc

### Text Sources

The poems in the keyboard.js sketch are generated by first making a long sentence using Markov chains generated with Markovify. Words are then randomly removed from this sentence in steps, and new ‘mirror’ sentences are generated using the removed words. The text for this process is sourced from various corpora, including De Re Metallica, a medieval mining text that bridged alchemy and modern metallurgy.

Python poetry generator scripts are found in the text_sources directory and are not directly used by the node/electron app

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wysiwyggins/Console.git
cd Console
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development

To run the project in development mode with hot-reloading:

```sh
NODE_ENV=development npm start
```

### Packaging

To build the project for production:

test with

```sh
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

build with

```sh
npm run build
```

The built application will be located in the `dist` directory.

## Building

To package the app for macOS and Windows:

```sh
npm run package
```

## Configuration

### Preload Script

The `preload.js` script exposes IPC methods to the renderer process:

```javascript
const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require('electron');

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('api', {
  getSharedState: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('get-shared-state'),
  setSharedState: (newState) => ipcRenderer.invoke('set-shared-state', newState),
  navigate: (url) => ipcRenderer.send('navigate', url),
  quitApp: () => ipcRenderer.send('quit-app'),
});
```

### Renderer Script

Example of handling the Escape key in the renderer process:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  if (event.key === 'Escape') {
    if (window.api) {
      window.api.quitApp();
    } else {
      console.error('api is not available');
    }
  }
});
```
